# Expressive Javascript: specify intent; reduce ambiguity

## Preface

This a manifesto for an expressive approach to reading & writing Javascript. Expressive has a double meaning:

### 1. It aims for code that is expressive in the literal sense; code that expresses intent in the least ambiguous way possible.

This takes a loose definition of expressionism as the opposite of impressionism, inasmuch as expressonism seeks to make concrete a distinct internal truth, whereas impressionism seeks to reflect a received feeling.

As this relates to code, we would describe cargo cult programming as impressionistic in that it perpetuates the developers' shared feeling of common sense that a certain code pattern feels like the right tool for the situation based on an experience of the results of broadly similar artefacts having the same surface appearance. This is an inate pattern-recognition approach to problem solving in the broad, but expressionism isn't satisfied with the end result, which without further analysis & iteration leaves all code looking similar: an expressive attitude would seek to identify the crucial logic and reformulate the code such that

### 2. In the domain-specific sense, it favours expressions to statements.
